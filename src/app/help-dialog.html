    Create teams from a list of people. This tool was originally built to make
    teams from families attending a school ping-pong tournament, but can be used
    to make teams from any set of people. The simplest way to use this tool is
    to enter one person per line and Team Generator will create random teams
    based on the options you select.
  </p>
  <p>
    Sometimes you may want more control over team creation. In particular, it is
    common to want certain people to be on different teams. With this tool you
    can controll that by putting those people on the same line separated by
    commas. Team generator will ensure people on the same line are put on
    different teams. For example, each line could represent a family whose
    members you want on different teams.
  </p>
  <p>
    You can go further by adding one or more categories to each line. Categories
    are created using colon separators, and allow you to control how people in
    those categories are distributed across teams. For example, each family line
    could have categories for kids and for parents that the tool will evenly
    distribute accoss teams to avoid teams of all parents or kids.

    Using the family example, here are are a few lines with four people. Since
    <i>Samantha</i> and <i>Sister</i> are on the same line they will be put on
    different teams.

    The next example adds categoriues with the use of a colon separator.
    Categories are used to distinguish between kids (before the colon) and
    parents (after the colon) on each line. People on a single line are still
    put on different teams and categories are used to evenly distribute people
    of the same category across teams.

    Rather than famlies with parents and kids, you can use whatever categories
    you have. For example, each line could be a school class with "TeacherList:
    StudentList". You can also not add any categories or use more than two. Team
    Generator will always try to put the people on each line onto different
    teams and then either spread out people in the same category or group them
    together based on the options you select.
