    Create teams from a list of people. This tool was originally built to make
    teams from families attending a school ping-pong tournament, but can be used
    to make teams from any set of people. Each line is a group of people who you
    want to be on different teams if possible. Each line could be a family or
    any group of people who you want on different teams. Within each line there
    are two categories of people, like parents and kids that this tool can
    either spread out on different teams or put together.
  </p>
  The format of each line is<br />
  <div class="help-dialog-section">ParentList : KidList</div>
  <div style="margin-top: 15px">
    Where <i>ParentList</i> and <i>KidList</i> are comma seperated names. For
    example, a line with two parents and one kid would be
  </div>
  <div class="help-dialog-section">
    <div #help1 style="flex-grow: 1">
      Ava Peters, Eric Peters : Weston Peters
    </div>
    <div style="height: 24px">
      <mat-icon
        (click)="onCopyExample();"
        [cdkCopyToClipboard]="help1.innerText"
        >content_copy</mat-icon
      >
    </div>
  </div>

  <div style="margin-top: 15px">
    The <i>ParentList</i> or <i>KidList</i> on each line can be empty. An
    example line with parents but no kids
  </div>
  <div class="help-dialog-section">
    <div #help2 style="flex-grow: 1">Jack Manning, Kelly Manning :</div>
    <div style="height: 24px">
      <mat-icon
        (click)="onCopyExample();"
        [cdkCopyToClipboard]="help2.innerText"
        >content_copy</mat-icon
      >
    </div>
  </div>
  <div style="margin-top: 15px">
    You may leave out the : seperator as a shortcut way to make each person on a
    line part of the <i>KidList</i> (the second category). An example line with
    only kids
  </div>
  <div class="help-dialog-section">
    <div #help2 style="flex-grow: 1">Samantha Peake, Sister Peake</div>
    <div style="height: 24px">
      <mat-icon
        (click)="onCopyExample();"
        [cdkCopyToClipboard]="help2.innerText"
        >content_copy</mat-icon
      >
    </div>
  </div>
  <div style="margin-top: 15px">
    Rather than famlies with parents and kids, you can use whatever categories
    you have. For example, each line could be a school class with "TeacherList:
    StudentList" or have just one category of people. Team Generator will always
    try to seperate the people on each line into different teams.
